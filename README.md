# ShuffleBird <img src="src/logo.png" alt="logo" width="22">
A random image viewer tool for artists that will display a slideshow of random images from a folder(or collection of folders) at set intervals.

I was using [quickposes.com](https://quickposes.com) and [line-of-action.com](https://line-of-action.com/) but I needed to have timed images with my own local collections (weapons, capes and other stuff I want to study). I couldn't find one, so I created my own with the same options to shuffle and display random images but from a local folder or create collections with set folders.
